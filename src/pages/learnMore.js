      <h2>Speakers & talks</h2>
      <p>Event starts @ 6:00pm. Talks start @ 6:15pm</p>
      <p>
        Event consist of several talks from various organisations about what
        they do. There will also be lightning talks from upto several
        individuals.
      </p>
      <h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
      <p>
        Lightning talks give people who would not normal speak give it a go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lightning talks allows upto 7 daring individuals chooses a random topic,
        but the twist is they are not allowed to be experts on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The individuals are give a month to research, learn, present their
        research and knowledge of the topic within 5 minute
      </p>
      <p>
        This might seem like a strange idea to some of you, however, one of the
        barriers to people speaking is that they always worry that they are not
        an "expert" on the topic, so never give the talks.
      </p>
      <p>
        By removing that "expert" barrier we hope that it gives people that
        opportunity to try out their speaking skills and also encourages
        everyone to learn topics they would have never looked at normally.
      </p>
      <p>
        In turn, we hope that this new talk format will bring fresh thinking,
        new topics and tech into every Codepen session. Clever huh?
      </p>
      <h3>Drinks & Pizza</h3>

        each other is important we're putting on drinks and pizza after the
